ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EdgarAllanPwn
I started learning basic web development when I was
 about 13 with nothing but a book on HTML and Notepad.
After a 20 year "hiatus", I'm here to finish
 what I started. My focus for now will be
 a distinct lack of focus, learning full stack
 development, one project at a time.
